PocketBase JSVM reference
blob
Namespace blob
Package blob defines a lightweight abstration for interacting with
various storage services (local filesystem, S3, etc.).
NB!
For compatibility with earlier PocketBase versions and to prevent
unnecessary breaking changes, this package is based and implemented
as a minimal, stripped down version of the previously used gocloud.dev/blob.
While there is no promise that it won't diverge in the future to accommodate
better some PocketBase specific use cases, currently it copies and
tries to follow as close as possible the same implementations,
conventions and rules for the key escaping/unescaping, blob read/write
interfaces and struct options as gocloud.dev/blob, therefore the
credits goes to the original Go Cloud Development Kit Authors.
