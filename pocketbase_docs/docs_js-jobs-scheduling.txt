Jobs scheduling
If you have tasks that need to be performed periodically, you could setup crontab-like jobs with
cronAdd(id, expr, handler)
.
Each scheduled job runs in its own goroutine as part of the
serve
command process and must have:
id
- identifier for the scheduled job; could be used to replace or remove an existing
        job
cron expression
- e.g.
0 0 * * *
(
supports numeric list, steps, ranges or
macros
)
handler
- the function that will be executed every time when the job runs
Here is an example:
// prints "Hello!" every 2 minutes
cronAdd
(
"hello"
,
"*/2 * * * *"
,
(
)
=>
{
console
.
log
(
"Hello!"
)
}
)
To remove a single registered cron job you can call
cronRemove(id)
.
All registered app level cron jobs can be also previewed and triggered from the
Dashboard > Settings > Crons
section.
