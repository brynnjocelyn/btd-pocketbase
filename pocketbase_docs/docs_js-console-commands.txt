Console commands
You can register custom console commands using
app.rootCmd.addCommand(cmd)
, where
cmd
is a
Command
instance.
Here is an example:
$app
.
rootCmd
.
addCommand
(
new
Command
(
{
use
:
"hello"
,
run
:
(
cmd
,
args
)
=
>
{
console
.
log
(
"Hello world!"
)
}
,
}
)
)
To run the command you can execute:
./pocketbase hello
Keep in mind that the console commands execute in their own separate app process and run
            independently from the main
serve
command (aka. hook events between different processes
            are not shared with one another).
