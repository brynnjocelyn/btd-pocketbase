multipart
Namespace multipart
Package multipart implements MIME multipart parsing, as defined in RFC
2046.
The implementation is sufficient for HTTP (RFC 2388) and the multipart
bodies generated by popular browsers.
Limits
To protect against malicious inputs, this package sets limits on the size
of the MIME data it processes.
[Reader.NextPart] and [Reader.NextRawPart] limit the number of headers in a
part to 10000 and [Reader.ReadForm] limits the total number of headers in all
FileHeaders to 10000.
These limits may be adjusted with the GODEBUG=multipartmaxheaders=
setting.
Reader.ReadForm further limits the number of parts in a form to 1000.
This limit may be adjusted with the GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=
setting.
