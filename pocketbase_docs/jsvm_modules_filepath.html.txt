filepath
Namespace filepath
Package filepath implements utility routines for manipulating filename paths
in a way compatible with the target operating system-defined file paths.
The filepath package uses either forward slashes or backslashes,
depending on the operating system. To process paths such as URLs
that always use forward slashes regardless of the operating
system, see the [path] package.
