Filesystem
PocketBase comes with a thin abstraction between the local filesystem and S3.
To configure which one will be used you can adjust the storage settings from
Dashboard > Settings > Files storage
section.
The filesystem abstraction can be accessed programmatically via the
$app.newFilesystem()
method.
Below are listed some of the most common operations but you can find more details in the
filesystem.System
interface.
Always make sure to call
close()
at the end for both the created filesystem instance and
            the retrieved file readers to prevent leaking resources.

Deleting files
Reading files
To retrieve the file content of a single stored file you can use
getFile(key)
.
Note that file keys often contain a
prefix
(aka. the "path" to the file). For record
    files the full key is
collectionId/recordId/filename
.
To retrieve multiple files matching a specific
prefix
you can use
list(prefix)
.
The below code shows a minimal example how to retrieve the content of a single record file as string.
let
record
=
$app
.
findAuthRecordByEmail
(
"users"
,
"test@example.com"
)
// construct the full file key by concatenating the record storage path with the specific filename
let
avatarKey
=
record
.
baseFilesPath
(
)
+
"/"
+
record
.
get
(
"avatar"
)
let
fsys
,
file
,
content
;
try
{
// initialize the filesystem
fsys
=
$app
.
newFilesystem
(
)
;
// retrieve a file reader for the avatar key
file
=
fsys
.
getFile
(
avatarKey
)
// copy as plain string
content
=
toString
(
file
)
}
finally
{
file
?.
close
(
)
;
fsys
?.
close
(
)
;
}
Saving files
There are several methods to save
(aka. write/upload)
files depending on the available file content
    source:
upload(content, key)
uploadFile(file, key)
uploadMultipart(mfh, key)
Most users rarely will have to use the above methods directly because for collection records the file
    persistence is handled transparently when saving the record model (it will also perform size and MIME type
    validation based on the collection
file
field options). For example:
let
record
=
$app
.
findRecordById
(
"articles"
,
"RECORD_ID"
)
// Other available File factories
// - $filesystem.fileFromBytes(content, name)
// - $filesystem.fileFromURL(url)
// - $filesystem.fileFromMultipart(mfh)
let
file
=
$filesystem
.
fileFromPath
(
"/local/path/to/file"
)
// set new file (can be single or array of File values)
// (if the record has an old file it is automatically deleted on successful save)
record
.
set
(
"yourFileField"
,
file
)
$app
.
save
(
record
)
Deleting files
Files can be deleted from the storage filesystem using
delete(key)
.
Similar to the previous section, most users rarely will have to use the
delete
file method directly
    because for collection records the file deletion is handled transparently when removing the existing filename
    from the record model (this also ensure that the db entry referencing the file is also removed). For example:
let
record
=
$app
.
findRecordById
(
"articles"
,
"RECORD_ID"
)
// if you want to "reset" a file field (aka. deleting the associated single or multiple files)
// you can set it to null
record
.
set
(
"yourFileField"
,
null
)
// OR if you just want to remove individual file(s) from a multiple file field you can use the "-" modifier
// (the value could be a single filename string or slice of filename strings)
record
.
set
(
"yourFileField-"
,
"example_52iWbGinWd.txt"
)
$app
.
save
(
record
)
