Console commands
You can register custom console commands using
app.RootCmd.AddCommand(cmd)
, where
cmd
is a
cobra
command.
Here is an example:
package
main
import
(
"log"
"github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
"github.com/spf13/cobra"
)
func
main
(
)
{
app
:=
pocketbase
.
New
(
)
app
.
RootCmd
.
AddCommand
(
&
cobra
.
Command
{
Use
:
"hello"
,
Run
:
func
(
cmd
*
cobra
.
Command
,
args
[
]
string
)
{
log
.
Println
(
"Hello world!"
)
}
,
}
)
if
err
:=
app
.
Start
(
)
;
err
!=
nil
{
log
.
Fatal
(
err
)
}
}
To run the command you can build your Go application and execute:
# or "go run main.go hello"
./myapp hello
Keep in mind that the console commands execute in their own separate app process and run
            independently from the main
serve
command (aka. hook events between different processes
            are not shared with one another).
