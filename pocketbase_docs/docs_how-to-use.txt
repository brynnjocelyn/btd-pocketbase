How to use PocketBase
The easiest way to use PocketBase is by interacting with its Web APIs directly from the client-side (e.g.
    mobile app or browser SPA).
It was designed with this exact use case in mind and it is also the reason why there are general purpose
    JSON APIs for listing, pagination, sorting, filtering, etc.
The access and filter controls for your data is usually done through the
collection API rules
.
For the cases when you need more specialized handling (sending emails, intercepting the default actions,
    creating new routes, etc.) you can
extend PocketBase with Go or JavaScript
.
For interacting with the
Web APIs
you can make use of the official SDK clients:
JavaScript SDK
(Browser, Node.js, React Native)
Dart SDK
(Web, Mobile, Desktop, CLI)
When used on the client-side, it is safe to have a single/global SDK instance for the entire lifecycle of
    your application.
Web apps recommendation
Not everyone will agree with this, but if you are building a web app with PocketBase I recommend
            developing the frontend as a
traditional client-side SPA
and for the cases where additional
            server-side handling is needed (e.g. for payment webhooks, extra data server validations, etc.) you
            could try to:
Use PocketBase as Go/JS framework
to create new routes or
                intercept existing.
Create one-off Node.js/Bun/Deno/etc. server-side actions that will interact with
                    PocketBase only as superuser and as pure data store (similar to traditional database
                    interactions but over HTTP). In this case it is safe to have a global superuser client
                    such as:
// src/superuser.js
import
PocketBase
from
"pocketbase"
const
superuserClient
=
new
PocketBase
(
'https://example.com'
)
;
// disable autocancellation so that we can handle async requests from multiple users
superuserClient
.
autoCancellation
(
false
)
;
// option 1: authenticate as superuser using email/password (could be filled with ENV params)
await
superuserClient
.
collection
(
'_superusers'
)
.
authWithPassword
(
SUPERUSER_EMAIL
,
SUPERUSER_PASS
,
{
// This will trigger auto refresh or auto reauthentication in case
// the token has expired or is going to expire in the next 30 minutes.
autoRefreshThreshold
:
30
*
60
}
)
// option 2: OR authenticate as superuser via long-lived "API key"
// (see https://pocketbase.io/docs/authentication/#api-keys)
superuserClient
.
authStore
.
save
(
'YOUR_GENERATED_SUPERUSER_TOKEN'
)
export
default
superuserClient
;
Then you can import directly the file in your server-side actions and use the client as
                    usual:
import
superuserClient
from
'./src/superuser.js'
async
function
serverAction
(
req
,
resp
)
{
...
do
some extra data validations or handling
...
// send a create request as superuser
await
superuserClient
.
collection
(
'example'
)
.
create
(
{
...
}
)
}
Why not JS SSR
Using PocketBase with meta framework such as SvelteKit, Nuxt, Next.js, etc.
in a JS SSR mode
is possible but it comes with many complications and you need to carefully evaluate whether the cost
            of having another backend (PocketBase) along-side your existing one (the Node.js server) is worth it.
You can read more about the potential problems in
JS SSR - issues and recommendations #5313
but some of the common pitfalls are:
Security issues caused by incorrectly initialized and shared JS SDK instance in a long-running
                server-side context.
OAuth2 integration difficulties related to the server-side only OAuth2 flow (or its mixed
                "all-in-one" client-side handling and sharing a cookie with the server-side).
Proxying realtime connections and essentially duplicating the same thing PocketBase already
                does.
Performance bottlenecks caused by the default single-threaded Node.js process and the
                excessive resources utilization due to the server-side rendering and heavy back-and-forth
                requests communication between the different layers (client<->Node.js<->PocketBase).
This doesn't mean that using PocketBase with JS SSR is always a "bad thing" but based on the
            dozens reported issues so far I would recommend it only after careful evaluation and only to more
            experienced developers that have in-depth understanding of the used tools and their trade-offs. If
            you still want to use PocketBase to handle regular users authentication with a JS SSR meta
            framework, then you can find some JS SDK examples in the repo's
JS SSR integration section
.
Why not htmx, Hotwire/Turbo, Unpoly, etc.
htmx, Hotwire/Turbo, Unpoly and other similar tools are commonly used for building server rendered
            applications but unfortunately they don't play well with the JSON APIs and fully stateless nature
            of PocketBase.
It is possible to use them with PocketBase but at the moment I don't recommend it because we lack
            the necessary helpers and utilities for building SSR-first applications, which means that you
            might have to create from scratch a lot of things on your own such as middlewares for handling
            cookies (
and eventually taking care also for CORS and CSRF
) or custom authentication
            endpoints and access controls (
the collection API rules apply only for the builtin JSON routes
).
In the future we could eventually provide official SSR support in terms of guides and middlewares
            for this use case but again - PocketBase wasn't designed with this in mind and you may want to
            reevaluate the tech stack of your application and switch to a traditional client-side SPA as
            mentioned earlier or use a different backend solution that might fit better with your use case.
Mobile apps auth persistence
When building mobile apps with the JavaScript SDK or Dart SDK you'll have to specify a custom
            persistence store if you want to preserve the authentication between the various app activities
            and open/close state.
The SDKs comes with a helper async storage implementation that allows you to hook any custom
            persistent layer (local file, SharedPreferences, key-value based database, etc.). Here is a
            minimal PocketBase SDKs initialization for React Native (JavaScript) and Flutter (Dart):
JavaScript
Dart
// Node.js and React Native doesn't have native EventSource implementation
// so in order to use the realtime subscriptions you'll need to load EventSource polyfill,
// for example: npm install react-native-sse --save
import
eventsource
from
'react-native-sse'
;
import
AsyncStorage
from
'@react-native-async-storage/async-storage'
;
import
PocketBase
,
{
AsyncAuthStore
}
from
'pocketbase'
;
// load the polyfill
global
.
EventSource
=
eventsource
;
// initialize the async store
const
store
=
new
AsyncAuthStore
(
{
save
:
async
(
serialized
)
=>
AsyncStorage
.
setItem
(
'pb_auth'
,
serialized
)
,
initial
:
AsyncStorage
.
getItem
(
'pb_auth'
)
,
}
)
;
// initialize the PocketBase client
// (it is OK to have a single/global instance for the duration of your application)
const
pb
=
new
PocketBase
(
'http://127.0.0.1:8090'
,
store
)
;
...
await
pb
.
collection
(
'users'
)
.
authWithPassword
(
'test@example.com'
,
'1234567890'
)
;
console
.
log
(
pb
.
authStore
.
record
)
import
'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart'
;
import
'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart'
;
// for simplicity we are using a simple SharedPreferences instance
// but you can also replace it with its safer EncryptedSharedPreferences alternative
final
prefs
=
await
SharedPreferences
.
getInstance
(
)
;
// initialize the async store
final
store
=
AsyncAuthStore
(
save
:
(
String
data
)
async
=
>
prefs
.
setString
(
'pb_auth'
,
data
)
,
initial
:
prefs
.
getString
(
'pb_auth'
)
,
)
;
// initialize the PocketBase client
// (it is OK to have a single/global instance for the duration of your application)
final
pb
=
PocketBase
(
'http://127.0.0.1:8090'
,
authStore
:
store
)
;
.
.
.
await
pb
.
collection
(
'users'
)
.
authWithPassword
(

'1234567890'
)
;
print
(
pb

authStore
.
record
)
;
React Native file upload on Android and iOS
At the time of writing, React Native on Android and iOS seems to have a non-standard
FormData
implementation and for uploading files on these platforms it requires the following
            special object syntax:
{
uri
:
"..."
,
type
:
"..."
,
name
:
"..."
}
Or in other words, you may have to apply a conditional handling similar to:
const
data
=
new
FormData
(
)
;
// result is the resolved promise of ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync
let
imageUri
=
result
.
assets
[
0
]
.
uri
;
if
(
Platform
.
OS
===
'web'
)
{
const
req
=
await
fetch
(
imageUri
)
;
const
blob
=
await
req
.
blob
(
)
;
data
.
append
(
'avatar'
,
blob
)
;
// regular File/Blob value
}
else
{
// the below object format works only on Android and iOS
// (FormData.set() also doesn't seem to be supported so we use FormData.append())
data
.
append
(
'avatar'
,
{
uri
:
imageUri
,
type
:
'image/*'
,
name
:
imageUri
.
split
(
'/'
)
.
pop
(
)
,
}
)
;
}
...
await
pb
.
collection
(
'example'
)
.
create
(
data
)
