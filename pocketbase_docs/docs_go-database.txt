Database
core.App
is the main interface to interact with the database.
App.DB()
returns a
dbx.Builder
that could run all kind of SQL statements, including
    raw queries.
Most of the common DB operations are listed below, but you can find further information in the
dbx package godoc
.
For more details and examples how to interact with Record and Collection models programmatically
            you could also check
Collection operations
and
Record operations
sections.

Executing queries
To execute DB queries you can start with the
NewQuery("...")
statement and then call one of:
Execute()
- for any query statement that is not meant to retrieve data:
res
,
err
:=
app
.
DB
(
)
.
NewQuery
(
"DELETE FROM articles WHERE status = 'archived'"
)
.
Execute
(
)
One()
- to populate a single row into a struct:
type
User
struct
{
Id
string
`db:"id" json:"id"`
Status
bool
`db:"status" json:"status"`
Age
int
`db:"age" json:"age"`
Roles  types
.
JSONArray
[
string
]
`db:"roles" json:"roles"`
}
user
:=
User
{
}
err
:=
app
.
DB
(
)
.
NewQuery
(
"SELECT id, status, age, roles FROM users WHERE id=1"
)
.
One
(
&
user
)
All()
- to populate multiple rows into a slice of structs:
type
User
struct
{
Id
string
`db:"id" json:"id"`
Status
bool
`db:"status" json:"status"`
Age
int
`db:"age" json:"age"`
Roles  types
.
JSONArray
[
string
]
`db:"roles" json:"roles"`
}
users
:=
[
]
User
{
}
err
:=
app
.
DB
(
)
.
NewQuery
(
"SELECT id, status, age, roles FROM users LIMIT 100"
)
.
All
(
&
users
)
Binding parameters
To prevent SQL injection attacks, you should use named parameters for any expression value that comes from
    user input. This could be done using the named
{:paramName}
placeholders in your SQL statement and then define the parameter values for the query with
Bind(params)
. For example:
type
Post
struct
{
Name
string
`db:"name" json:"name"`
Created  types
.
DateTime
`db:"created" json:"created"`
}
posts
:=
[
]
Post
{
}
err
:=
app
.
DB
(
)
.
NewQuery
(
"SELECT name, created FROM posts WHERE created >= {:from} and created <= {:to}"
)
.
Bind
(
dbx
.
Params
{
"from"
:
"2023-06-25 00:00:00.000Z"
,
"to"
:
"2023-06-28 23:59:59.999Z"
,
}
)
.
All
(
&
posts
)
Query builder
Instead of writing plain SQLs, you can also compose SQL statements programmatically using the db query
    builder.
Every SQL keyword has a corresponding query building method. For example,
SELECT
corresponds
    to
Select()
,
FROM
corresponds to
From()
,
WHERE
corresponds to
Where()
, and so on.
users
:=
[
]
struct
{
Id
string
`db:"id" json:"id"`
Email
string
`db:"email" json:"email"`
}
{
}
app
.
DB
(
)
.
Select
(
"id"
,
"email"
)
.
From
(
"users"
)
.
AndWhere
(
dbx
.
Like
(
"email"
,
"example.com"
)
)
.
Limit
(
100
)
.
OrderBy
(
"created ASC"
)
.
All
(
&
users
)
Select(), AndSelect(), Distinct()
The
Select(...cols)
method initializes a
SELECT
query builder. It accepts a list
    of the column names to be selected.
To add additional columns to an existing select query, you can call
AndSelect()
.
To select distinct rows, you can call
Distinct(true)
.
app
.
DB
(
)
.
Select
(
"id"
,
"avatar as image"
)
.
AndSelect
(
"(firstName || ' ' || lastName) as fullName"
)
.
Distinct
(
true
)
...
From()
The
From(...tables)
method specifies which tables to select from (plain table names are automatically
    quoted).
app
.
DB
(
)
.
Select
(
"table1.id"
,
"table2.name"
)
.
From
(
"table1"
,
"table2"
)
...
Join()
The
Join(type, table, on)
method specifies a
JOIN
clause. It takes 3 parameters:
type
- join type string like
INNER JOIN
,
LEFT JOIN
, etc.
table
- the name of the table to be joined
on
- optional
dbx.Expression
as an
ON
clause
For convenience, you can also use the shortcuts
InnerJoin(table, on)
,
LeftJoin(table, on)
,
RightJoin(table, on)
to specify
INNER JOIN
,
LEFT JOIN
and
RIGHT JOIN
, respectively.
app
.
DB
(
)
.
Select
(
"users.*"
)
.
From
(
"users"
)
.
InnerJoin
(
"profiles"
,
dbx
.
NewExp
(
"profiles.user_id = users.id"
)
)
.
Join
(
"FULL OUTER JOIN"
,
"department"
,
dbx
.
NewExp
(
"department.id = {:id}"
,
dbx
.
Params
{
"id"
:
"someId"
}
)
)
...
Where(), AndWhere(), OrWhere()
The
Where(exp)
method specifies the
WHERE
condition of the query.
You can also use
AndWhere(exp)
or
OrWhere(exp)
to append additional one or more
    conditions to an existing
WHERE
clause.
Each where condition accepts a single
dbx.Expression
(see below for full list).
/*
SELECT users.*
FROM users
WHERE id = "someId" AND
    status = "public" AND
    name like "%john%" OR
    (
        role = "manager" AND
        fullTime IS TRUE AND
        experience > 10
    )

The following
dbx.Expression
methods are available:

        to the corresponding values.
// slug = "example" AND active IS TRUE AND tags in ("tag1", "tag2", "tag3") AND parent IS NULL
dbx

        column should be like. If multiple values are present, the column should be like
all
of them.
By default, each value will be surrounded by
"%"
to enable partial matching. Special
        characters like
"%"
,
"\"
,
"_"
will also be properly escaped. You may call
Escape(...pairs)
and/or
Match(left, right)
to change the default behavior.

OrderBy(), AndOrderBy()
The
OrderBy(...cols)
specifies the
ORDER BY
clause of the query.
A column name can contain
"ASC"
or
"DESC"
to indicate its ordering direction.
You can also use
AndOrderBy(...cols)
to append additional columns to an existing
ORDER BY
clause.
app
.
DB
(
)
.
Select
(
"users.*"
)
.
From
(
"users"
)
.
OrderBy
(
"created ASC"
,
"updated DESC"
)
.
AndOrderBy
(
"title ASC"
)
...
GroupBy(), AndGroupBy()
The
GroupBy(...cols)
specifies the
GROUP BY
clause of the query.
You can also use
AndGroupBy(...cols)
to append additional columns to an existing
GROUP BY
clause.
app
.
DB
(
)
.
Select
(
"users.*"
)
.
From
(
"users"
)
.
GroupBy
(
"department"
,
"level"
)
...
Having(), AndHaving(), OrHaving()
The
Having(exp)
specifies the
HAVING
clause of the query.
Similarly to
Where(exp)
, it accept a single
dbx.Expression
(see all available expressions
    listed above).
You can also use
AndHaving(exp)
or
OrHaving(exp)
to append additional one or
    more conditions to an existing
HAVING
clause.

The
Limit(number)
method specifies the
LIMIT
clause of the query.
app
.

(
)
.

From
(
"users"
)
.
Limit
(

Offset()
The
Offset(number)
method specifies the
OFFSET
clause of the query. Usually used
    together with
Limit(number)
.
app
.
DB
(
)
.
Select
(
"users.*"
)
.
From
(
"users"
)
.
Offset
(
5
)
.
Limit
(
30
)
...
Transaction
To execute multiple queries in a transaction you can use
app.RunInTransaction(fn)
.
The DB operations are persisted only if the transaction returns
nil
.
It is safe to nest
RunInTransaction
calls as long as you use the callback's
txApp
argument.
Inside the transaction function always use its
txApp
argument and not the original
app
instance because we allow only a single writer/transaction at a time and it could
            result in a deadlock.
To avoid performance issues, try to minimize slow/long running tasks such as sending emails,
            connecting to external services, etc. as part of the transaction.
err
:=
app
.
RunInTransaction
(
func
(
txApp core
.

)
error
{
// update a record

err
